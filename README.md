Raiker is a local-first AI-agent runtime. Every model interaction and tool
action passes through policy, capability gates, approvals, and audit records, so
local automation stays under your control.

The launchable local UIs are the plain local terminal client and the local web dashboard — `raiker` and `raiker-app` (or `raiker-web` for explicit service control), the latter on `127.0.0.1`; Phase 8 deferred clients are not available. Approving a proposed file change performs it once, under a fresh gate, policy and posture check, with the previous contents checkpointed. Approved local `shell`, SSH and Daytona actions likewise execute once through their dedicated governed executors; other approvals remain decision-only. Durable memory mutation is broker-governed, and strict non-allow blocking, role revoke governed, and capability gate per action are enforced.

## Quick start

Python 3.11+, Node 20+, Git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sharRahul/Raiker.git
cd Raiker
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"

npm --prefix apps/web ci
npm --prefix apps/web run build

raiker-app                              # detects your OS and opens your browser
```

## `raiker-app` command

`raiker-app` is the application entry point. It keeps its data where your
platform expects an application to (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Raiker` on Windows,
`~/Library/Application Support/Raiker` on macOS, `$XDG_DATA_HOME/raiker` on
Linux — `RAIKER_HOME` overrides all three), binds a free loopback port, and
opens your default browser. If a Raiker is already running it opens that one
rather than starting a second host over the same encrypted workspace. Run
`raiker-app --print-paths` to see what it resolved.

Installation and PowerShell command-not-found help are in
[Getting started](docs/guide/getting-started.md#install).

Subcommands cover the rest of the host's life. Bare `raiker-app` still means
"start Raiker", so a desktop shortcut is unaffected:

```bash
raiker-app service install    # start in the background at sign-in, using your
                              # platform's own service manager: launchd on
                              # macOS, systemd --user on Linux, the Startup
                              # folder on Windows
raiker-app service status     # show whether background startup is registered
raiker-app service uninstall  # remove background startup registration
raiker-app status             # running / paused / needs attention / stopped,
                              # and what background work is in flight
raiker-app pause              # stop starting new background work; already
                              # approved work is allowed to finish
raiker-app resume             # resume scheduled background work
raiker-app quit               # stop the host, reporting waiting work first
raiker-app uninstall          # print exactly what removal takes and what it
                              # keeps; add --yes to carry it out, and
                              # --data keep|export|erase per instance
raiker-app update             # what this build is: signed release, unsigned
                              # build, or source checkout. Add --check to ask
                              # the pinned channel, --apply to install what it
                              # offers, --rollback VERSION to go back
```

To keep project-local data in the repository workspace instead of the default
platform data directory, pass `--workspace` consistently. Options work before
or after the subcommand:

```powershell
raiker-app --workspace .
raiker-app --workspace . service install
raiker-app service status --workspace .
```

The same controls are in the app: the **Host** control in the top bar reports
the state, names what a quit would interrupt, offers Pause, Restart and Quit,
and — under **Install & updates** — says what this build is and whether an
update channel is pinned. Opening it makes no outbound request; Raiker contacts
no update service until you pin one.

Releases are built by `.github/workflows/release.yml`, started deliberately from
the Actions tab. It builds a reproducible payload per platform on that
platform's own runner, proves it rebuilds to the same bytes, runs an
encrypted-database packaging test there, builds that platform's installer, and
signs the channel index the updater verifies. **It refuses to build without
code-signing identities** rather than producing something that looks like a
release; run it with `signing: skip` to exercise the pipeline and you get
artifacts named `-unsigned` that the product itself calls unsigned and that the
publish job will not release. No signed artifact has been published yet. The
first-run wizard and a native tray icon are still to come — see
`docs/DESKTOP_DISTRIBUTION_DESIGN.md` and BUG-48 in
[to be fixed](docs/plans/TO_BE_FIXED.md).

`raiker-web` remains the service entry point for an explicit workspace and port,
and is the only path that can bind beyond loopback (`--allow-public`, which also
requires a hardened owner token):

```bash
raiker-web --workspace . --no-browser   # then open http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

First run uses **owner bootstrap** to create your local **owner principal** — a
username and password held on this machine. There is no cloud account. Every
request thereafter resolves an **acting-principal**.

To connect a hosted model, start the server with the provider's host allowlisted:

To connect a hosted model, open **Models**, press **Connect** on the provider,
and paste your API key. That is the whole flow — see
[Connecting a model](docs/guide/connecting-a-model.md).

## Owner-authoritative and monitored

Raiker is **owner-authoritative and monitored, not prevention-by-restriction**.
Security here is not restricting you; it is letting you operate without having
your own access taken away.

**Configuring something is permission for it.** Saving a provider's credential
is the authorization to use that provider, and the endpoint you configured is
authorised with it. You are not then asked to satisfy a separate switch, a
separate host allowlist, and a separate encryption key before the thing you just
set up will run.

That consent is scoped and revocable, never a blanket opening: configuring
Anthropic authorises `api.anthropic.com` and nothing else, a provider you have
not configured still fails closed, and a capability you *explicitly* turn off
stays off whatever is configured.

Controls that stand between an AI-proposed action and it happening:

| Control | Where | What it decides |
|---|---|---|
| **Agent runtime** | Settings → Runtime configuration | Whether Raiker accepts new executions at all |
| **Capability gate** | Permissions | Whether this capability exists for you at all |
| **Decision mode** | Permissions, or the Chat composer | Ask / Allow / Auto / Deny before each action |
| **Approval** | Approvals | A human decision on the specific proposed action |

Opening a higher-risk gate is a governed step-up: a human `runtime_gate_manager`,
a reason, a short phrase they type to record their intent, and a threat-model
acknowledgement — all recorded against your principal. The phrase is not a
credential. Owner **recovery** is governed and audited.

A human `runtime_gate_manager` alone may change capability gates or stop the
agent runtime.

There is one runtime. Raiker used to ship five modes — a development preview,
two single-user modes, a multi-user mode and a hosted mode — and require one to
be selected before a capability could reach runtime level. That was a second
switch in front of the switches that decide anything: what an action may do is
already settled by its capability gate, its threat-model acknowledgement, its
human confirmation, and whether a real executor exists for it. The single
runtime does all of it, and the only runtime-level decision left is binary —
accepting executions, or stopped.

The approval detail says what will happen **before** you decide. A proposed
**file change** is performed once, through the governed
approval execution relay — re-governed at execution time, with the previous
contents checkpointed so it can be rewound, and never into `.raiker/` or
`.git/`. Approved **SSH remote** and **Daytona cloud** actions execute once
through bounded, owner-selected profiles with fresh policy, posture, credential,
host-key, and cost-ceiling checks, and an approved local **shell** command runs
once against an allowlist, inside the workspace, under a timeout and an output
bound, with secret-like output redacted before it is recorded. Network and
process approvals record the decision and execute nothing. Disabling either the
`approval_execution_relay` or
`file_write_execution` capability returns file approvals to record-only, and a
critical approval always uses the human-only, step-up-verified lifecycle
instead.

Deferred dangerous domains — finance, medical, CCTV, home security, and hardware actions — have no governed executor
and therefore offer no enable path at all. They fail closed and are listed under
Observability → Diagnostics.

Raiker stays frictionless for safe local work: you remain in control, while
zero-trust verification is applied at every authority boundary.

## What is in the dashboard

| Group | Destinations |
|---|---|
| Home | **Workbench** — resume work, see what needs attention |
| Work | **Chat**, **Build**, **Search Chat**, **Tasks**, **Projects** |
| Knowledge | **Memory**, **Knowledge Map** |
| Control | **Approvals**, **Permissions**, **Models**, **Extensions** |
| Observe | **Observability** — readiness, audit log, checkpoints, live work, notifications, sessions |
| Utilities | **Settings** |

Highlights, each verified against a live instance:

- **Chat** — streamed turns against local or hosted models, image and document
  attachments, a recent-chat list with rename/pin/archive/move, and full-text
  search across titles and message bodies.
- **Tasks** — four work types: run now, schedule once, daily routine, and a
  persistent background agent; nestable, prioritised, and stoppable at a safe
  boundary.
- **Models** — local, home-lab, hosted, and advanced providers; live provider
  catalogues; an encrypted per-instance credential vault; a user-owned fallback
  sequence with no silent hosted fallback; and per-provider token and API-cost
  accounting with each figure's source named.
- **Extensions** — governed service connectors and Model Context Protocol
  servers you can build, connect, monitor, and contain, plus **Skills**:
  `SKILL.md` documents and `*.skill` bundles you upload, import from a
  verified GitHub link, build in place, activate or deactivate, download, and
  delete. A skill adds instructions only — it grants no capability and opens
  no gate.
- **Observability** — an append-only audit log, metadata-only checkpoints, and
  an honest readiness report derived from stored state, never a probe.

The layout adapts live: a bottom bar plus drawer below 640 px, a menu trigger
plus drawer to 1023 px, and the full sidebar at 1024 px and above.

## Known limits

Raiker's documentation does not run ahead of its code. As of 2026-08-08:

- **Approved network and process actions still do not run** — approval
  resolution executes file changes and patches, bounded local `shell` commands,
  and the owner-configured SSH and Daytona profiles. `network` and `process`
  keep metadata-only resolution. This is deliberate, not an oversight: a file
  write is checkpointed and reversible, and a shell command is allowlisted,
  workspace-contained, time- and output-bounded, and captured; those two are
  neither. Resolving one still continues the parked turn, with an honest
  "approved, but not executed" result the agent can react to.
- **A batch of tool calls runs in parallel only when nothing in it needs a
  decision.** Every validated read-only call in a batch is executed
  concurrently; the moment one call in the same batch requires approval, the
  whole batch is walked serially and pauses at that call. Nothing behind the
  pause is lost — the remainder is parked with the turn and re-governed one
  decision at a time when you resume — but a batch containing three edits is
  three decisions, not one.
- **Build patching is strict about matching, not about scope.** One unified
  diff may cover several files, including creates and deletes, and it is
  applied as a single approval and a single reversible change set. What stays
  strict is the match: exact edits require exactly one `old_text` match, every
  hunk must match its context exactly and unambiguously, a section that edits or
  deletes must name a text file that already exists inside the workspace and one
  that creates must name a path that does not, and a patch naming the same file
  twice is rejected before anything is written. There is no fuzzy or partial
  application — one bad hunk fails the whole proposal.
- **A push needs its own switch, its own allowlist and your own credential.**
  An approved `git_commit` records the change set you reviewed, and an approved
  `git_push` really publishes the branch — but publishing is egress carrying
  repository content off the machine, so it answers to **Git push**
  (`git_push_execution`) rather than to Git writes, and it does nothing until
  the remote's host is on `RAIKER_CONNECTOR_EGRESS_ALLOWLIST` and
  `RAIKER_GITHUB_TOKEN` is set. Only HTTPS GitHub remotes are pushable, because
  that is the credential Raiker holds; it never forces and never deletes a
  branch. `github_write` then has a head to open a pull request against.
- **The agent reaches the web only where you have allowed it, and cannot search
  at all until you configure a provider.** `web_fetch` is gated by its own
  capability, withholds by default at `ask`, and fetches nothing while
  `RAIKER_WEB_EGRESS_ALLOWLIST` is empty. `web_search` answers the same gate,
  but Raiker ships no search endpoint: it reports `web_search_not_configured`
  until you point it at one.
- Automatic context compaction at 90 % and weekly quota display are specified
  but not shipped. The view-only file inspector is shipped.
- **Shipped list prices are unverified defaults.** `config/model-profiles.json`
  seeds prices only for the models whose published rate is recorded there, each
  stamped with an `as_of` date. Check them against your provider's current
  pricing page and override anything that has moved; an unpriced model reports
  its cost as unknown rather than as zero.

Where one of these is tracked as work rather than a deliberate boundary, it is
written up with a reproduction and a proposed fix in
[docs/plans/TO_BE_FIXED.md](docs/plans/TO_BE_FIXED.md). The entries that closed
the older limits this section used to list are FIXED-34, FIXED-39, FIXED-90,
FIXED-99, FIXED-101 and FIXED-109 there, and
[ADD-02](docs/plans/TO_BE_ADDED.md) in the companion document.
